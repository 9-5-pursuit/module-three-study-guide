## Creating branches

- How would you create a branch called `add-product-feature`?
- What are some best practices when naming branches?
- What are some good examples of branch names?
- How could you prefix your branch name with your name or username?

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

## Viewing branches

- What identifier does terminal give to the current branch you are working on?
- How do you exit the screen that shows your list of branches?

```bash
git branch
```

## Switching to a branch

- What terminal changes do you notice after changing branches?
- Run `git branch` again after switching, what has changed?
- What's the difference between `switch` and `checkout`?

    [Git Docs for Reference](https://git-scm.com/docs)

```bash
# Switch Branches
git switch <branch-name>
git checkout <branch-name>

# Create Branch AND Switch
git switch -c <branch-name>
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

## Merging branches locally

- What is the following code doing?
- Which branch is being merged into which?
- What kind of branch is `add-product-feature`?

```bash
# Syntax
git merge <branch-name>

# Example
git switch main
git merge add-product-feature
```

## Branches with Github

It is common when working on a team to follow this process:

1. Create a new feature branch.
1. Complete work on that feature branch.
1. Push your feature branch to GitHub.
1. Create a Pull Request.
1. Have someone else on your team review your code.
1. Merge your Pull Request from GitHub.

This process is a good one to follow because it allows you to share your work with other members of your team.

### Pushing branches to Github

- What does the `origin` represent in this code?
- What branch should you be on when you push?

```bash
# Syntax
git push origin <branch-name>

# Example
git switch add-product-feature
git push origin add-product-feature
```

### Merging via Github

- When you push a branch to Github, what does it offer you the option to do?
- Why should you share your pull request with other team members when working on a team?
- Which branch are the changes merged into?

## Pulling

- What does a pull accomplish?
- What's the difference between these two commands?

```bash
git pull origin main
git pull
```

## Deleting Branches

- How would you delete a local branch called `add-product-feature`?
- How would you delete a remote branch called `add-product-feature`?
- What is the purpose of deleting branches?
- Can you delete a branch that you're currently on?
- Does deleting a branch remove it permanently?

```bash
# Delete Local Branch
git branch -d <branch-name>
git branch --delete <branch-name>

# Delete Remote Branch
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

### __CHALLENGE__: Figure out what this code is shorthand for.

```bash
git push origin :add-product-feature
```
